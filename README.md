A user can register their item on our smart contract and it’s given a unique id
The item has the number of transactions
If it’s for sale or not: 
In the meta data: the price it was sold at every time it was handed off to another person
In the meta data: who in the past has ever owned the item

Once you’ve registered the item: cell item function you’re listing the item for sale
if someone clicks into the sale, then you have to send the ether you’re selling, it’s successful, then add to the total number, then transfer the owner
